And never on the clothes?\n\nSmall high fashion brand Boyarovskaya, due to their small output, decided to show off their minimalist, elegant womenswear collection with a surrealist show of two looks. TWO LOOKS. Its strange to see under 10 looks in a runway LET ALONE TWO. I didn't know what to expect from a collaborative fashion company between a designer AND A PHOTOGRAPHER but after this, it makes sense. Everything is perfectly done to sell Maria Boyarovskaya's vision, from the music to the cinematography to the set to the editing. Wow. This really shouldn't have been half as good as it was."}

The music matched a lot of the time, but sometimes it didnt fully sell her vision. \n\nMy biggest issue was easily the camerawork OH MY GOD THE CAMERAWORK. With these lovely designs, I expect closeups of every piece, I want to see every detail that Miuccia must have obsessed over, but the camerawork just... doesn't do that. Instead, it focuses on unnecessary elements of the runway show. Its always good to have a Long Shot or Super Long Shot to establish the runway location at the beginning of a show, but WHY DOES IT CUT TO THIS CAMERA ONCE EVERY TEN SECONDS GIRRLLLL I DONT NEED THIS üò≠üò≠ JUST GIVE ME CLOSEUPS OF THE CLOTHING"}

The camerawork perfectly shows the pieces, meanwhile the sound selection is PERFECT for the vibes of the show.\n\nThat being said, the music really did a bad job at presenting the glamour of this collection. Yes, the sounds perfectly fit, but the music wasnt dramatic enough ‚Äî no climaxes, no rhythm changes, it got really boring."}

I assume the designs were predominantly greyscale - and if so, it was a great idea to film in black and white, but when theres no camerawork (one angle, no movement), it really just makes the runway more boring. There were no closeups of the pieces, detracting from the quality of this runway. \n\nHowever, the set was chosen perfectly - the models walking through the sharp metal arch very well matched with the straight lines on the pieces. Another great choice was the music - matched the vibes very well, but I do believe that the climaxes in the music should've had some amazing pieces come out instead of pretty...standard pieces from the line."}

It had a major theme of balloons and sparkles, many looks being made of balloons and balloon-like textiles. As such, the centre of the runway were shiny bubbles. \n\nThe music perfectly fit, changing with the pieces being shown, bright and sparkly with the over-the-top pieces, moody during the all-black looks. \n\nI didnt expect to like this so much, but the runway was absolutely stunning ‚Äî the camerawork was even perfect!! Only thing I can fault it on is the audio ‚Äî I wish I could hear the sound the textiles made as the models walked."}

The music is goofy, it breaks the confidence I feel in the creative vision. The editing doesn't focus on the pieces - which a lot of the time, i enjoy. Instead it cuts between each look, barely showing the details."}
